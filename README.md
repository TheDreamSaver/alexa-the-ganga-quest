# The Ganga Quest

A legendary voyage up the River Ganga looking for the missing book of Panchatantra. You take decisions that decide the path between progress and disappointment.

Follow a mythical journey up the River Ganga from the Bay of Bengal in search of the missing section of the Panchatantra, a work of wisdom by Vishnu Sharma.

But you have choices to make that could determine the difference between success and failure. Which will it be?

Explore new cities along the banks of the river, including Kolkata and Kashi. Challenge yourself with decisions that can affect the whole rest of the story. Do you save the Jackal, or do you leave the Jackal to die? Be wary of the Crocodileâ€™s riddle! Remember, every decision you make, every choice you click, can affect the final outcome of your journey. Choose wisely! You need to figure out how you can earn the most Wisdom Points. Earn points based on your decisions, and work towards finding the missing book, which may as well hold the fate of the next few eons in its pages. Save the Panchatantra and play Ganga Quest now!!
